**â€˜The Earth is Us: Love letters to the earthâ€™**  
**call out for contributions to webzine**


 *â€˜The Earth is not just our environment. We are the Earth and the Earth is us. We have always been One with the Earth. Realizing this, we can see that the earth is truly alive. We are a living, breathing manifestation of this beautiful and generous planet. Knowing this, we can begin to transform our relationship to the Earth. We can begin to walk differently and to care for her differently.*

*We will fall completely in love with the Earth. When we are in love with someone or something, there is no separation between ourselves and the person or thing we love. We do whatever we can for them and this brings us great joy and nourishment. That is the relationship each of us can have with the Earth.â€™*  
Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh

Inspired by Thich Nhat Hanhâ€™s â€˜Love letters to the Earthâ€™ , I am putting together a collective webzine for World Earth Day 2025, and invite you to contribute.

Send me your own  â€˜Love letter to the Earthâ€™ in any form \- artwork or visuals  (of any kind) stories, poems, songs, soundscapes, videos, recordings, anything that expresses your experience of interconnection with our planet and its many forms of life-   from animal to plant, water or mineral life.

The zine will be landscape in format, but you can send your contributions in any dimensions and in any file format.

All of the contributions will be put together into a collective interactive webzine and be published online on 22nd April, World Earth Day to celebrate our interconnections with and love for our planet.

Send your contributions to Jean at [theearthisus0@gmail.com](mailto:theearthisus0@gmail.com) by Monday April 11th.  Sound and video submissions are welcome via links to other platforms \- eg YouTube, vimeo etc 

If you have any questions, get in touch via the email address above\!  
Warm wishes and look forward to receiving your contribution.

Jean
